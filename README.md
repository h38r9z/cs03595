1. True or false. (25   points,   5   points   each)
Are the following statements true or false?   Explain your answer in no more than two sentences.   You   will   be   graded   on   your   explanation.
(i)    Historically,   low   dividend-price   ratios   of   the   SP   500   have   predicted   high    (positive)   subsequent   price   growth   and   essentially   no   subsequent   change   in   dividends.
(ii)    The    following   fact   violates   the   semi-strong   form   of   the   efficient   markets   hypothesis:   prices   of   companies   tend   to   increase   a   few   days   before   public   announcement   of   good   news.
(iii)   When the   risk-free   rate   increases,   the   optimal   portfolio   share   of risky   assets   for   a   mean-   variance   investor   declines.
(iv)   In   a   CAPM   equilibrium,   since   investors   are   compensated   for   holding   risk, two   securities   with   the   same   standard   deviation   should   have   the   same   expected   return.
(v)    Consider   a   European   call   and   a   European   put   for   the   same   non-dividend-paying   stock,   same   expiration   T,   and   same   strike   X,   where   X   = F   and   F   is   the   forward   price   of the   underlying   for   delivery   date   T.   Under   no   arbitrage, the two options have   the   same   price   today.
2. Welfare efects of risk. (20 points, 5 points   each)
Consider   an   economy   where   CAPM   holds,   the   risk-free   rate   is   Rf         = 2%,   and   the   return   of the   market   portfolio   has   expectation   E[Rm] = 10% and   standard   deviation   40%.
(a)   Draw   the   capital   allocation   line.      What   is   the   optimal   portfolio   of   a   mean-variance   investor   with   risk   aversion   A   =   2?    What   is   the   mean   and   standard   deviation   of   this portfolio?   Show this portfolio in the ﬁgure.   What   is   the   value   of this   investor’s   mean-   variance   utility   function   if   he   invests   in   this   optimal   portfolio   (i.e.,   what   is   E[Rp] -   (A/2)Var(Rp))?(b)   What is the optimal portfolio of an investor with risk aversion A = 4?   What is its mean and   standard   deviation?   Show   this   portfolio   in   the ﬁgure   (from   part   (a)) as   well.   What is the value of this investor’s mean-variance utility function when investing optimally?
(c)   Now suppose that due to a reduction in uncertainty, the standard deviation of the mar-   ket return   falls to   20%,   while other   parameters   are   unchanged.    Draw the   new   capital   allocation   line   (in   a   new   ﬁgure).    What   are   the   new   optimal   portfolios   of the   two   in-   vestors?   What are these portfolios’ means and standard   deviations?   Show them   in   the   ﬁgure.   Which investor’s portfolio share of risky assets changes by more after the change   in   the   standard   deviation   of   the   market   return?   Why?
(d)   What are the values of the two investors’ utility functions now, given their new optimal   investments?   Which investor’s utility increases by more after the change in the standard   deviation   of   the   market   return?   Why?
Comment   on   this   statement:    “Reductions   in   risk   are   most   beneﬁcial   to   conservative   investors who are highly sensitive to fluctuations in their wealth.”
3. Capital budgeting. (30   points,   5   points   each)Consider   an   economy where the   risk-free rate   is   Rf    = 4%, the   expected   return   on   the   market   portfolio   is   E[Rm]   =   12%,   and   the   standard   deviation   of the   return   on   the   market   portfolio   is   20%.       The   covariance   between   the   return   on   ABC   stock   and   the   return   on   the   market   portfolio   is   0.06.    All   of   this   data   refers   to   annual   returns.    Suppose   that   ABC   stock   pays   a   dividend   of   $10   per   share   next   year,   and   dividends   are   expected   to   grow   at   a   rate   of   2%   per   year.
Recall   that   under   the   Gordon   Growth   Model   (GGM),   we   can   write   the   price   of   a   stock   at   any   time   t   as
Pt = R−g/Dt+1
where   R   is   the   discount   rate   and   g   is   the   growth   rate   of dividends.
(a)    ABC’s   manager   argues   that   according   to   the   Gordon   Growth   Model   (GGM)   his   shares   should   sell   for   a   price   of $10/(.04 - .02) =   $500.    Explain   why   this   valuation   is   inappro-   priate.
(b)    Assuming that   CAPM holds,   compute ABC’s beta   with   respect   to   the   market   portfolio,   and   the   expected   rate   of return   of ABC   stock.
(c)    Given   your   answer   to   (b),   what   price   does   the   GGM   imply   for   a   share   of ABC   stock?
(d)   It   turns   out   that   the   market   price   of   ABC   is   $50,   which   is   diferent   from   what   you   computed   in   (c)   [if not,   you   made   a   mistake!].   However,   you   realize   that   ABC   has   only   narrowly avoided bankruptcy last year,   and has   a   very   high   book-to-market   ratio.    Is the   fact   that   ABC   has   a   lower   price   than   what’s   predicted   by   part   (c)   consistent   with   what   you   know  代 写Econ 136 Final Spring 2024R
代做程序编程语言 about   the   expected   return   of stocks   with   high   book-to-market   ratios?   Why?
(e)    Now   you   want   to   apply   a   more   sophisticated   asset   pricing   model   than   CAPM   to   price   ABC. Let HML   = RH   -RL denote the excess return of value stocks over growth stocks,   and   SMB   =   RS    - RB      the   excess   return   of   small   stocks   over   big   stocks.    Suppose   that   ABC   has   a   beta   of   1.5 with   respect to   HML,   and   a   beta   of zero with   respect   to   SMB.   The beta of ABC with respect to the market   portfolio   is   still   what   you   computed   in   part   (b).   If the   expected   excess   return   of value   stocks   over   growth   stocks   is   E[HML]   = 4%,   what   should   be   the   expected   return   of ABC   according   to   the   Fama-French   model?   Is   it   higher   or   lower   than   the   expected   return   you   computed   in   (b)?   Why?
(f)    Using   the   expected   return   you   computed   in   part   (e),   what   should   the   price   of   a   share   of   ABC   stock   be   according   to   the   GGM?   Does   your   answer justify   the   market   price   of   $50?
4. Options. (25 points, 5 points   each)Consider   an economy in three periods,   t   =   0,   t   =   1   and   t   =   2.    Suppose that   a   stock   index   behaves   as   follows:   the   initial   index   value   at   time   t   =   0   is   100,   and   each   period   the   index   either rises by   15 or   falls   by   5   with   equal   probability   (so   for   example   at   t   =   2,   the   highest   possible index value is 100+15+15=130).   The index does not pay dividends during these two   periods.   The   riskfree   rate   of   return   each   period   is   Rf      = 0%.
Now   consider   a   European   call   option   on   the   index,   with   expiration   date   t   =   2,   and   strike   price   X   = 100.
(a)   Draw the event tree for   this   economy.    For each   node   in   period   t   =   1   and   t   =   2,   write   St, the   current   price   of   the   index.    For   each   node   at   t   =   2,   write   the   payof   of   the   call option.
(b)   Consider   the   node   where   the   stock   price   has   gone   up   to   115   in   period   1.    Construct   a portfolio at this node   that   replicates   the   payof   of the   option   in   both   possible   states   at   t   =   2.    Speciﬁcally,   assume   that   at   this   node,   you   purchase   x    shares   of the   index   and y   shares of the riskfree asset.   Solve for x   and   y   from   the   assumption   that   this   is   a   replicating portfolio.   What is the price of this portfolio at t   = 1   (in the event when the stock price is S1    = 115)?   What is the price   of the option,   C1?
(c)   Following a similar procedure as in   (b), now solve for the price of the option at t   =   1 in   the event when the stock price   is   S1    = 95.
(d)   Now go back to period t   = 0.   To compute C0, construct a portfolio of   the index and the   riskfree asset that pays   C1      in period   t   =   1   (that   is,   the   number   you   obtained   in   (b)   if the price goes up in period   1, and   the   number   you   obtained   in   (c)   otherwise).   What   is   the price of this portfolio?   What is the price of the call option?
(e)   Suppose that a European put option on the index with expiration t   = 2 and strike price   X   =   100   is traded   at   a price of P0      =   5.425.    Is   there   an   arbitrage   opportunity   in   this economy?    If yes,   construct   a   portfolio   of the   put,   the   call,   the   index   and the   riskfree   asset   to   exploit   it.   If   not, why?

(a)    For   a   non-dividend   paying   stock,   construct   two   portfolios   at   time   t,   that   have   the   same   payof   at   time   T,   and   use   the   law   of one   price   to   establish   the   following   relationship:
f = S — K · e-r(T-t)
(b)    Noting   that   when   a   forward   contract   is   initiated,   the   forward   price   equals   the   delivery   price,   which   is   chosen   so   that   the   value   of the   contract   is   zero,   show   that:
F   = S · er(T-t)
(c)   At maturity,   a forward contract pays of   ST   —   K.    By risk-neutral valuation   we   can   write   f = e-r(T-t)ERN[ST — K]
where ERN[·] indicates we are taking the expectation using the risk-neutral probabilities.Recall that   in   a“risk-neutral world”(i.e., when the   objective   probabilities   and   the   risk-   neutral   probabilities   coincide)   the   expected   return   of   all   risky   assets   is   r.   Use   this   fact   to   carefully   derive   the   relationship   from   part   (a).
